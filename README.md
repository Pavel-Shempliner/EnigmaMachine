# Enigma Machine Simulator

A web-based Enigma machine simulator built with Python and Streamlit. This project replicates the functionality of the historical German Enigma machine used during WWII.

## Features
- Web-based user interface (via Streamlit)
- Authentic simulation of a 3-rotor Enigma machine
- User-configurable rotors, plugboard wiring, and starting positions
- Symmetric encryption/decryption
- Instructions panel for historical usage reference
